## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498db), providing a sense of trust and technology. A lighter variant will be used for interactive elements.
- Background color: Very light blue (#f0f8ff). The goal is to ensure a clean, modern aesthetic without distracting from the bot interactions. Its brightness will complement the dark color scheme, promoting readability and focus on the textual content.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00ffff). Using this vivid color will highlight key interactive elements, subtly encouraging user actions. It maintains an overall feeling of energy and progress without overwhelming the visuals.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font with a modern and neutral appearance, for both headlines and body text.
- Consistent use of flat, minimalist icons to represent bot functions and categories. Icons will use the primary color for emphasis.
- Clean and structured layout with a focus on easy navigation. The dashboard should be intuitive, guiding users through the bot creation and management process seamlessly.
- Subtle animations for bot status changes and data loading to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
